Contribution to the *Micko* (Mini C Compiler) is made in terms of adding an interactive graphical interface and layer displaying stages of compilation and analyzing the code before showing the final assembly code.
The code is highlighted in colors to help match the corresponding pieces of generated code in different phases, to aid and boost the understanding of the compiling process.

GUI is based on Node.js and HTML in order to provide the best platform portability.
